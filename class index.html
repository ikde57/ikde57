        There could be many reasons. On of all is that the government itself provides big support to the league and pre-education due to the enormous interest. The players play and exercise in good condition. They rest well, treated well and get paid in crazy degree. But the most important factor must be the passion of the youth. Basketball is one of the most famous sports in the U.S.. People always play it, watch it and introduce it to people.
